## Dating Recommendation System
Two most common type of reccomender systems are Content-Based and Collaborative Filetering.
I used a dating site dataset to reccomend profile a user will like based on the wisdom of crowd (Collaborative Filtering)
This recommendation system showcases both Memory based and Model Based Collaborative Filtering recommender systems. To recommend users both user-user and item-item Recommender System are implemented using cosine similarity and SVD.
